= Edge documentation

This directory represents the Edge documentation module.

It is explicitly referenced by `app`.

Asciidoc sources can be found in link:resources/doc/sources[].

The JUXT documentation style is in
link:resources/doc/asciidoctor/css/juxt.css[], which is built using
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-stylesheet-factory[].

The module contains some ClojureScript support in
link:src/edge/doc/doc.cljs[].

== Building on Edge

If you use Edge at the springboard for your own application, we
suggest you might consider retaining this documentation module, and
modify the Asciidoc sources accordingly. We hope this module gives you
a head-start in your own documentation efforts.
