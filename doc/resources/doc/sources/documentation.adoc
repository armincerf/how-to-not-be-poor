= Documentation

We think it's a good idea to continue to document your project as we've done with Edge.
You might want to update the CSS stylesheet, source highlighting and other Asiidoctor attributes.
They can be found in `doc/resources/doc/asciidoctor/attributes.edn`.

== Updating the footer in HTML documentation

If the footer has a copyright declaration from JUXT, you can update this by updating `doc/resources/doc/docinfo/docinfo-footer.html`.
This file name must not be changed as it is looked for by Asciidoctorj when
generating the HTML output.
