== Intro

For newcomers to the Clojure language it can be quite a daunting task to put together a real Clojure application from scratch.
That's why we've done this initial step for you and creating a project that you can learn from and build upon.

This isn't merely a toy application.
Edge is JUXT's baseline architecture which we use for our own professional Clojure projects.
The name is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_reference[Datum edge].
